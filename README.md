# CourseWork(3 sem)
Topic: Development of an automated food delivery service system.
The developed course project should be presented in the form of a console application. As part of the work on the course project, the following tasks must be implemented:
1) Development of a user menu that includes the following options: separation of roles, user authorization, password storage in encrypted form; viewing, adding, editing, and deleting records; search, sort and filter records; order implementation (data output in the form of a report); other options depending on the specifics of the automated task.
2) Storage of initial and final information in text or/and binary files. To store data in RAM, use STL library containers (Standard Template Library).
3) The use of the following program constructs in the program: implementation of the basic principles of object-oriented programming (abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism);
- using abstract classes;
- using passing parameters by reference and by value;
- using built-in, user-friendly, virtual functions;
- using namespaces (built-in and native);
- implementation of program error handling (using C++ language);
- using method and operator overloading, overriding methods;
- using class templates and methods;
- using static methods and fields.
- using dynamic memory allocation and smart pointers.
- using C++ streams, overloading input/output operators, controlling work with the stream.
